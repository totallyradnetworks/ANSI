# ANSI/TIA 570-D Residential Telecommunications Infrastructure Standard

This Standard provides specifications for telecommunications premises cabling systems and related pathways and spaces requirements for single- and multi-dwelling (e.g., campus) residential buildings. These specifications apply to both the telecommunications cabling within and between residential dwelling units. This Standard specifies three grades of cabling based upon the services that are expected to be supported within each residence.

#### Grade 1
Provides a generic cabling system that meets the minimum requirements for basic telecommunications services such as telephone, satellite, community antenna television (CATV), and data services.

* 1 - CAT6A or higher
* 1 - 75ohm Coaxial
* 1 - 2-Fiber Optical Cable(optional)

#### Grade 2
Provides a generic cabling system that meets the minimum requirements for basic and advanced telecommunications services to include the technologies referenced for Grade 1 plus highâ€‘speed internet, wireless access points, and in-home generated video.

* 2 - CAT6A or higher
* 2 - 75ohm Coaxial
* 1 - 2-Fiber Optical Cable(optional)

#### Grade 3
Provides a generic cabling system that meets the minimum requirements for basic and advanced telecommunications services to include the technologies referenced for Grade 2 plus consideration for applications operating over optical fiber cabling.

* 2 - CAT6 or higher
* 1 - 75ohm Coaxial
* 1 - 2-Fiber Optical Cable
